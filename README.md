# Project Owner: Martin Munyao


# Project Name: Bookstore Management System (BMS)


# Problem Statement

Several bookstores face a challenge of inventory management. Customers come to buy the books only for the owner to realize that there is none left which may take several days to make the order and get the delivery therefore losing potential customers who opt to buy elsewhere. It becomes hectic to keep track of all the books available and books that are not available using the traditional file system. 


# Solution
Create an online application that allows bookstore owners to keep track of their inventory and make orders before they run out of stock.


# MVP
    • Inventory
    • Books available
    • Books almost running out of stock
    • Landing page
